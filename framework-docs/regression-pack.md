## regression pack purpose and expectations

To ensure the stability and reliability of our software, we have set up automated regression tests to run every night at midnight using GitHub Actions.
These tests cover a wide range of critical functionalities and scenarios, allowing us to detect any potential regressions or issues that may arise.
By running these tests regularly, we can proactively identify and address any issues before they impact our users.
This automated regression testing process helps us maintain the quality and integrity of our software, providing a seamless experience for our users.
